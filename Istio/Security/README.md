## Security
Istio comes with a couple of custom resource definitions for configuring user and service-to-service authentication and authorization policies.

In this module, we’ll learn about the Istio security features. We’ll explain access control in Istio, what authentication and authorization mean, how the different Istio resources work together to answer the access control question, secure naming, identity, mutual TLS, and more.
