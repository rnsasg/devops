### Brief review
We covered a lot of ground in this course. We:

- Began with an overview of service meshes in general and of Istio in particular.
    * Discussed different ways to install Istio, and the three main pillars of service meshes: Observability, Traffic management, and Security.
    * Covered advanced topics including multi-cluster deployments, VM onboarding, and extensibility with Wasm plugins.
    * Concluded with modules on troubleshooting and real-world examples.

### What next?

* Work through the [Envoy Fundamentals course](https://academy.tetrate.io/courses/envoy-fundamentals). Envoy is the principal building block of Istio. If you wish to deepen your expertise with this technology, the natural next step is to learn about Envoy.

* Build practical experience with Istio. This course alone is not sufficient to become proficient with Istio. Study should be complemented with practical experience. Look for opportunities to build hands-on experience with Istio, either in the context of your work, or by performing small discovery projects with Istio.

* Study from additional Istio resources. The [Istio reference documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/) contains many complementary resources including How-toâ€™s, blogs, and a complete reference to the Istio CRDs, commands, including the Istio CLI, and more.

* When you feel that your expertise with Istio has grown, consider registering for the [Certified Istio Administrator by Tetrate (CIAT)](https://academy.tetrate.io/courses/certified-istio-administrator) examination. This certification exam is performance-based, similar to the Kubernetes certification exams.
