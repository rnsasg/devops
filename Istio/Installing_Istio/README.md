# Installing Istio
The main objective of this module is to learn how to install Istio, and the different methods that are available for installing Istio.

In the first lesson, we dive right in to topics pertaining to installation. The lab towards the end of this module demonstrates the process of performing an Istio installation using the Istio CLI.

In this module, you will find two additional lessons that are related to the subject of installation:

An introduction to the GetMesh CLI, a useful tool for fetching and otherwise working with multiple Istio distributions and versions.
A discussion of the Istio feature “discovery selectors”, which provides a way to control which namespaces Istio should be watching.

## Steps

1. [Discovery Selector](./discovery_selector.md)
2. [Get Mesh](./get_mesh.md)
3. [Istio Components](./istio_components.md)
4. [Istio Installation Lab](./istio_installation_lab.md)
