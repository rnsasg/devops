# Traffic Management
In this module, we will get started with routing traffic between services using Istio service mesh. We will learn how to set up an Ingress resource to allow traffic into our cluster as well as an Egress resource to enable traffic to exit the cluster.

Using the traffic routing, we will learn how to deploy new versions of services and run them next to the released, production version of the service, without disrupting production traffic. With both service versions deployed, we will gradually release (canary release) the new version and start routing a percentage of incoming traffic to the latest version.
