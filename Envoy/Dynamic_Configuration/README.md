# Dynamic Config
In this module, we’ll learn about configuring Envoy proxy using dynamic configuration. Up until now, we’ve been using static configuration. This module will teach us how to provide configuration for individual resources from the file system or over the network using discovery services at runtime.

By the end of this module, you’ll understand the difference between static and dynamic configuration.
